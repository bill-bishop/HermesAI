# DropCode Monorepo

DropCode is a **Dropbox-style app for developers** that provides seamless file sync, GitHub integration, and GPT-powered coding assistance. It is designed as a monorepo for easier development and collaboration.

---

## Features
- **File Sync (Dropbox-style)**: Real-time syncing of local workspaces with conflict resolution.
- **GitHub Integration**: Auto-committing, PR workflows, and repo mirroring.
- **GPT Hooks**: Connect workspaces with custom GPT models for refactoring, testing, and documentation.
- **Collaboration**: Shared workspaces, inline reviews, and team coding support.
